### World_Weather_Analysis
### Add the weather description to the weather data retrieved in this module. Add input statements to filter the data for the weather preferences. These preferences will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, four cities are chosen to create a travel itinerary. Using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route will be created between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

### I chose to limit the cities to the US to narrow the iterary cities. The final map is of the 4 cities with the itinerary pop up markers.
